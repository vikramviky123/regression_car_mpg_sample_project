        <h1 class="h-primary"><span>Welcome to Miles per Gallon Regression Problem</span></h1>

        <p>
            The dataset for this excersize is car performance over mileage, 
            Our task is to predict the target `mpg` of car listed in dataset.

        <h1><span>Context:</span></h1>
        <p>
             `Miles per Gallon(mpg)` is the most factor to determine how effcient the 
            car in fuel consumption when compared to other cars. There are several factors 
            affect the 'mpg' like road conditions, wind, temperature externally. 
            But internally factors like engine displacement, weight, number of cylinders etc 
            can also be very crusical in determing the `mpg`.

        <p>The dataset contains mileage per gallon (MPG) data for various cars, along with information about several independent variables and the target variable. The following are the key details:</p>
    
        <h2 class="h-secondary"><span>Independent Variables:</span></h2>
        
        <ul class="data-list">
            <li><strong>cyl</strong><strong>:</strong> Number of engine cylinders in the engine.</li>
            <li><strong>disp</strong><strong>:</strong> Engine Displacement in cubic centimeters (cc).</li>
            <li><strong>hp</strong><strong>:</strong> Horse Power.</li>
            <li><strong>wt</strong><strong>:</strong> Weight in kilograms (kgs).</li>
            <li><strong>acc</strong><strong>:</strong>Acceleration in meters per second squared (m/sÂ²).</li>
            <li><strong>yr</strong><strong>:</strong> Year the car was made (YYYY).</li>
            <li><strong>origin</strong><strong>:</strong> Origin of the car.</li>
            <li><strong>car_type</strong><strong>:</strong> Type of the car.</li>
            <li><strong>car_name</strong><strong>:</strong> Name of the car.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="h-secondary"><span>Target Variable:</span></h2>
        <p><strong>mpg:</strong> Fuel consumption per gallon in miles per gallon (mpg/kmpl).</p>
